# Breathtaking Comics

**Breathtaking Comics** is both a shared setting of comic-book superheroes and supervillains,
and a tabletop role-playing game for adventures in that or any similar setting.

The rules are available in two versions:

* [EIC Edition](/rules/eic-edition) are the rules as an in-character memo from the Editor in Chief for a comic-book publisher
* [Melvin Edition](/rules/melvin-edition) are an abbreviated quick-start or reference version, covering just the basics

Both versions include some inline tools for randomly creating characters or rolling dice, allowing you to jump in immediately.

The rules, settings, characters, and other details are licensed under the CC-BY 4.0 license unless otherwise indicated.
This means that you can freely use them in your own works, as long as you provide proper attribution.
