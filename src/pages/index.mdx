# Breathtaking Comics

**Breathtaking Comics** is both a shared setting of comic-book superheroes and supervillains,
and a tabletop role-playing game for adventures in that or any similar setting.

The rules are available in two versions:

* [EIC Edition](/rules/eic-edition) are the rules as an in-character memo from the Editor in Chief for a comic-book publisher
* [Melvin Edition](/rules/melvin-edition) are an abbreviated quick-start or reference version, covering just the basics

Both versions include some inline tools for randomly creating characters or rolling dice, allowing you to jump in immediately.

Whether you use the rules or not, you can find heroes, villains, and more under [The Breathtaking World](/world).

**December 19, 2025**: [Serket](https://www.fluoriteguillotine.com/about.html) blogged about the game!
