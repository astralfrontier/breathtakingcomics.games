# The Oakland Ogre

Timmy Valentine always wanted to be a bad guy.
The kids in his neighborhood talked big, and but they only laughed when he talked like them.
As he grew older, he heard stories about people engaging in street races, or robbing liquor stores, and he wanted to be a cool rebel like them.
In trying, he got sent to juvenile detention a few times, and his parents always bailed him out.
They'd lecture him, but it never stuck.

When the mutation struck, and he became big and strong and ugly, it was like God answering his prayers.
He'd finally be the tough, badass rebel he'd always dreamed of being.
At no time did it occur to him to try to be a hero.
Those guys are boring!
He took the name "the Ogre", only to learn there were like a dozen Ogres already in the villain world.
Okay, fine, he could qualify it with his neighborhood.
Local pride, right?

The thing is, he doesn't have what it takes.
He doesn't have the desperation or creativity you develop when growing up is hard.
He doesn't know who he is, he only knows the other people he wants to be.
So he'll do small, unimaginative jobs like legbreaking and loan sharking for the Mob,
intimidation and arson for greedy real-estate tycoons, and simple henching for established supervillains.
He doesn't want money or revenge.
He wants what his strength alone can't give him: to be _noticed_.

# Drives (for heroes)

- Stop the Oakland Ogre's current heist
- Get the Oakland Ogre to divulge his current boss's scheme
- Keep the Oakland Ogre from destroying something important by accident

# Moves

- Smash something!
- Make a boast you can't back up
- Try something bold and screw it up destructively

# Variations

## Competence

- Timmy can't be the villain he aspires to be. But what if he notices that fact, and starts consciously building on his actual strengths? If he's treated as a joke for too long, by too many people, he might hide behind that persona while he improves his villain game. And then they'll all see, oh yes…
- On the other hand, Timmy can be not only small-time, but comically inept. His plans to rob a bank go south when he arrives at a bingo parlor instead. His armored car heist failed when the cars just smashed through him and kept driving. He might not be a real danger, but he can be a persistently annoying speed-bump to their attempts to save the city.

## Power Level

- Timmy Valentine could be weaker, or lack powers entirely. Maybe he's just got a football player's muscular build, and he'd do anything to get a mutagen or experimental treatment or something that would give him actual superpowers.
- He could also be stronger, either naturally or artificially. A seriously tough Ogre is still the Oakland Ogre, and he won't do much with it except accidentally break things (and perhaps ruin a scheme in the process).

## Leaders and Followers

- Timmy might have his own group of henchmen. They might be hangers-on trying to be tough like him, newcomers to town who don't know he's basically a nobody, or professional goons just trying to do a job and get paid.
- What if Timmy actually catches a villain's eye? They might use him as an expendable decoy for an important operation with empty promises. The heroes might need to save the Oakland Ogre from himself.
