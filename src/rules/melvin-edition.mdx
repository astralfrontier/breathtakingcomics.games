This game is about telling comic-book superhero stories. Every player speaks with equal authority. You can look to individual players for leadership, but no one player can overrule the others.

# Getting Started

Review and agree on Safety tools (https://ttrpgsafetytoolkit.com).

Talk about touchstones - what inspires you, what you want to do, and so on. Take notes on what you all discussed.

# Terms

- **Issue**: a single session of the game, typically 2-4 hours long
- **Page**: a set of Panels in which every player got to contribute something
- **Panel**: a moment of action where one or more characters do something meaningful
- **Trait**: a short, descriptive element of a hero character
- **Hook**: a negative consequence or situation that can arise from a character's Traits
- **Drive**: a dramatic stake for a scene, such as endangered civilians or a villain's caper
- **Test**: a die roll that pushes Drives into Red (bad) or Green (good) state

# Characters

There's a character keeper online at `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rsOkFlM126924W7jByv6jpMdIegf65HFMxXgP4MXoR8/copy`

Create a character concept, such as "disillusioned patriot".

Write short descriptive phrases for these five Traits: **Position** (on the team), **Past** (backstory), **Personality** (driving emotion), **Powers** (superhuman abilities), and **Problems** (dramatic difficulties).

Write three or so Hooks for each Trait, describing its dark sides, complications, or conflicts. Hooks are examples, not exclusive conditions.

Assign d10, d8, d8, and d6 to Position, Past, Personality, and Powers in any order. Problems do not have their own die.

# Tests

During play, when you roll a Test with any of these Trait dice, step it down one size (e.g. d10 to d8, d8 to d6). Do not step down once a die is at d4.

If two or more heroes contribute to a Test, they both roll, and both dice step down. Use the highest rolled value for the outcome of the Test.

Any time a Hook for a non-Problems Trait comes into play, step it back up, no further than the maximum you assigned at start. Any time a Hook for the Problems trait comes into play, step up the die for any Trait you want.

# Drives

Drives are the dramatic stakes in play during a scene. Drives enter a scene in a neutral state, but may be moved to Red (bad) or Green (good) status by rolling Tests.

- 1-2: one Drive flips to Red
- 3-4: one Drive flips to Red, another Drive flips to Green
- 5-9: one Drive flips to Green
- 10+: two Drives flip to Green

When a Drive flips color, explain what happened and why this was the result.

The group can strike a Drive, locking in its current state for the scene. Strike a Drive when the group feels like the issue is settled, or if the Drive is no longer interesting.

Anyone can add a new Drive at any time. One Drive can evolve into another new Drive if appropriate.

When a Drive changes state, take notes on what happened.

# Scenes

There are three types of Scenes: Crisis (fights and action-packed scenes), Challenge (accomplishing a difficult or complex task), and Open (freeform story-telling).

The general goal of a scene is to make Tests that flip as many Drives to Green as possible.

## Crisis Scenes

1. Each player makes a list of 3 plot points, 2 focused on the crisis and 1 focused on themselves or the team as people
2. The group arranges these plot points into a single narrative by finding causal connections for things to happen
3. The group turns this narrative into 6-12 Drives
4. The group plays through a Page of action
5. On each Page, each hero gets to make one Test, either in their own Panel or sharing a Panel with other Heroes
6. Adjust the status of one or more Drives depending on the Test result
7. If any Hooks were narrated, step up Trait dice if appropriate
8. At the end of Pages 1-3, move a single Drive to Red
9. At the end of Pages 4 and on, select one Drive and strike it
10. The scene ends when half of all Drives have been struck

## Challenge Scenes

1. Write a single Drive for the overall nature of the challenge
2. Each player contributes a single extra Drive
3. Pick a number of Panels to play through, from 4 (hard) to 6 (medium) to 8 (easy)
4. Each Panel has one hero making a Test to shift Drives
5. No hero may make a second Test until every hero has made a first
6. The scene ends when every Panel has been played through

## Open Scenes

Open Scenes are freeform roleplaying. Drives and Tests may be used as the players see fit.

# Callbacks

At the end of every scene, players may lay claim to Drives. Players may have at most one Red and one Green Drive stored as Callbacks. Each Drive may only be claimed by one player.

Callbacks may be spent to roll a d12 for a Test. A Callback can't be used in the same Issue it was collected.

# Letters To the Editor

At the end of each Issue, describe a letter to the editor that a typical reader might write. Talk about what you like or didn't like about the Issue.

# Character Tuning

At the end of each Issue, you can revise every aspect of your character, including Traits, Trait dice assignments, and Hooks.
