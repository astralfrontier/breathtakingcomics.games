# Wavelength

Wavelength is an online forum dedicated to "exploring the outer limits of superhuman existence".
Its members are (or claim to be) researchers into superhuman powers and events.
It publishes studies of superhuman powers, spreads rumors and information about possible superhuman involvement in current events,
and studies historical records for evidence of supers from the past.

Wavelength is notorious as a source of conspiracy theory.
Many of their stories sound crazy, and some are; others turned out to be partially (or completely) true.
Critics claim the boards are a mixture of grifters and the gullible.
Then again, Wavelength has broken some very real and very serious stories.

## Popular Theories

Some of Wavelength's more famous ongoing stories and pernicious memes include:

**Killclone**: the assertion that in 2008, a super with shapeshifting and duplication powers was going to
systematically murder and replace world leaders, thus leading to a "New World Order" headed by the villain himself.

**The Ahnenerbe**: many Wavelength stories concern the activities of Nazi Germany and a secret cadre of superhumans,
usually associated with the think-tank called the Ahnenerbe.
This group was claimed to be responsible for everything from the emergence of superpowers to expeditions to Inner Earth, lost continents, and the like.

**Lost Cities of the USSR**: some Wavelength members claim that "lost cities" exist in Russia and other former Soviet member states.
These locations were sealed off from the world using holography or hypnosis, or were buried under the earth using drilling machines, and so forth.
What they are doing now ranges from harmless (research into using geothermal energy to grow plants rather than sunlight)
to dangerous (crossbreeding powered superhumans with hypothetical reptoid races).

**Historical events**: everything from Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids to the sinking of the Spanish Armada has been attributed to superhumans.

# Drives (for heroes)

- Research a superhuman mystery on the forums
- Track down a prolific poster whose expertise can help the current situation
- Deal with the fallout of somebody posting about the heroes (whether it's true or false)

# Panels

The heroes are reading a provocative comment or important revelation on the forums. Who could have posted that?
