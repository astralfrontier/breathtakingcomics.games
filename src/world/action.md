# A.C.T.I.O.N.

The Advanced Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Operations Network tracks superhuman threats all over the world.
Agents are a mixture of off-the-books heroes, reformed villains, and specialists in relevant fields.
They deal with viral bioweapons, genetically engineered monsters, captured aliens, telepathic spies, and much more.

Temptation is ever-present, whether it's wealth and power or a chance at revenge. And not everybody the Agents go after is what they seem.

A.C.T.I.O.N. is for...

- Globe-trotting espionage scenarios
- Dirty deeds done for the greater good
- Stories about loyalty, betrayal, and secrets

# Drives (for heroes)

- A.C.T.I.O.N. agents have an interest in some high-tech dingus which may clash with what the heroes want
- A villain in A.C.T.I.O.N. custody escaped, and the agency asks for help
- The agency has answers to the heroes' problem, but their aid won't come cheap
