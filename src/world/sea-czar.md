# Sea-Czar

Earth's surface is 70% water. The depths of the oceans harbor life unseen and unguessed by those on the surface.
The mysterious "Emperor of Earth's Oceans", Sea-Czar, claims all of this as his dominion.

His origins are a mystery.
Many believe he was a marine biologist named Decio Gennari, whose experiments with controlling fish behavior and
the possibility of grafting marine organs onto human bodies were too extreme even for the secretive Onyx Corporation that funded him.
The good doctor was lost when an oil rig, converted into a secret bioweapons laboratory, sunk beneath the waves in a suspicious "accident".

Sea-Czar has either allied with some underwater civilization, or discovered the secrets of one.
He controls devices that can manipulate the shape of water across vast areas.
He uses this to deploy his armies of sharks, squid, kraken, and darker entities of the Abyss onto land.
Aside from his mastery of water and aquatic life,
Sea-Czar has engineered himself (and a few loyal lieutenants) with the best the sea has to offer.
Superior squid eyes and camouflage, dolphin echolocation, the incredible regeneration of the axolotl,
and other abilities make him physically formidable even without his other resources.

Sea-Czar seems to prefer intimidation to conquest.
He wants the surface to avoid dumping chemicals into the oceans,
and wants to harshly regulate fishing, shipping, and other human pursuits on and in the ocean.
He rules his preferred empire, and sees his actions as punishing interlopers in his domain.

Don't underestimate what such a person is capable of.
Nuclear submarines lost at sea may have given him access to nuclear weapons,
and it remains to be seen how far he'll go to enforce his will on the surface.
He can tap into underwater cables, giving him access to vast amounts of Internet traffic, including financial data.
Blowing up a dam or causing a tsunami can instantly flip control over some area from surface-dwellers to him and his fishy minions.

# Drives

- Respond to Sea-Czar's invasion of a major city
- Rescue a ship or submarine from Sea-Czar's clutches
- Thwart Sea-Czar's attempted theft of an important chemical or device

# Panels

Spheres of water over just over the city.
Inside them are all manner of sea creatures, all multicolored, sporting fins, tentacles, and far too many eyes.
They're emerging to terrorize the citizens of the city, or drag them into the water spheres.
On the crest of a tidal wave that's poised to drown the city but is held back by mysterious forces,
Sea-Czar is standing with arms folded.
He has the poise of an army general overseeing his forces.

Sea-Czar, or his minions and lieutenants, wield mysterious technological artifacts
which create walls and weapons out of liquid water.

A hero tries to engage Sea-Czar in hand-to-hand.
The villain can use a squid's camouflage and ink, a deep-sea fish's toxins,
an electric eel's shocks, and a dolphin's echolocation
to outmaneuver the hapless hero.

# Variations

## Origin

- Is Sea-Czar a disgruntled biochemist who's reinvented himself as the dark king of the seas?
  If so, he might want something other than simple terror - he might want revenge against someone who wronged him
- Sea-Czar could also be a native of some mysterious underwater civilization such as Atlantis or Mu

## Dominion

- Sea-Czar might be the undisputed master of the undersea realm,
  or he could be in competition with existing underwater societies
- Alternatively, he could be working for some such civilization, whether he's a native or a modified human being

## Power

- Sea-Czar's control over sea life is assumed to be scientific in nature: biochemistry, genetic engineering, or something else.
  Likewise, his mysterious mastery over water is assumed to come from some kind of device
- On the other hand, it's easy to imagine him as a dark sorcerer, using eldritch magics or making bargains
  with Lovecraftian entities to manipulate the horrors of the deep
