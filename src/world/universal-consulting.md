# Universal Consulting

The Universal Consulting team is a close-knit group of supernatural creatures, who use their skills for their own purpose.
Each is modeled on a classic Universal Pictures creature, and the team structure closely follows that of the television show "Leverage".

Sometimes the team helps the downtrodden, while other times they commit a complex heist for their own ends.
They work out of a private office, taking jobs that nobody else can or will do.
Their methods attract the attention of monster-hunters and law enforcement alike,
forcing them to stay a step ahead of enemies in both the daytime and night.

- The Mastermind: **Niles Freund**, an ancient Egyptian mummy. A priest while alive, he understands politics and planning at a high level. Undead and immortal, with assorted sorcerous abilities.
- The Hitter: **Siobhan Wagner**, a werewolf. Able to control the change between human and wolf-creature. Mild healing factor and superior physical attributes, all greatly enhanced by the transformation.
- The Hacker: **Earl Kent**, a ghost. May possess computers and devices, or even manipulate mechanical objects with psychokinesis. Able to enter the dreams of the living to learn their secrets.
- The Grifter: **Helen Brown**, a vampire. A centuries-old double-dealer with mesmeric charm and a sensual side.
- The Thief: **Griff Whalen**, an invisible human. An accomplished cat burglar and second-story man who is permanently invisible thanks to a serum.

Universal Consulting is for...

- Bringing in classic monsters in a modern context
- Mixing the supernatural and espionage genres, which can be a fruitful and interesting mixture
- Giving high-tech or mundane-but-skilled characters a challenge outside their normal skill set
