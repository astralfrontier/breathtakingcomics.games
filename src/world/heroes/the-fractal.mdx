# The Fractal

The woman known as the Fractal is, by her own choice, a complete mystery.
She presents herself as a dark-clad vigilante with a small arsenal of useful gadgets, from grappling lines to forensic scanners.
She's able to disappear from locked rooms, recover from broken bones a day later, wield a dozen martial arts styles, employ top-level scientific knowledge from a dozen fields.
Her great secret is that she's able to duplicate herself.
This, combined with her mastery of disguise and imitation, means that she has dozens of "doubles" out in the world - studying, learning, watching.

Her parents were researchers on the fringes of interdimensional science.
An experiment blew up, thanks to a saboteur hired by a rival organization. It sent her parents into another dimension, and endowed their young daughter with the power to "fractal" herself into pieces, then recombine later.
She can rescue them, though - if they're still alive.
She's done the science.
The saboteur is entangled with a unique quantum key.
All she has to do is check every possible suspect for the signature.
And there's a world full of suspects...

She has a variety of secret identities, from college students studying a variety of subjects, to beat cops, criminals, detectives, and scientists.
She is a student, adventurer, athlete, and more in her various incarnations.
Her mind is spread across the duplicates, allowing her to instantly know what any of her selves are aware of.

# Drives

- Thwart crime through fear and misdirection
- Restore order to a chaotic city
- Save lives, one at a time

# Panels

The Fractal drops into a new fighting stance never before seen, or unveils a newly invented gadgets, and puts it to immediate and expert use.

The Fractal, a few paces ahead of her enemies, races into a room and slams the door behind her.
As the bad guys barge in, they find the room empty. Where did she go?

Other heroes saw the Fractal take a nasty beating last night.
This morning she's rattling off a synthesis of three different scientific disciplines like nothing happened.
Can she be hurt? Does she ever sleep?

# Variations

## Wealth

- How does she get those wonderful toys? It's possible she doesn't have the fancy gadgets often associated with other vigilantes, and has to make do with a few key things like a grappling gun.
- On the other hand, it's possible she's turned her skills and power toward money-making on the side, letting her amass a small fortune.

## Personal Life

- The classic vigilante is a dark and brooding hero who barely has time for love or relationships. The Fractal might follow that pattern, shutting herself off from close relationships in any incarnation. This might actually make her stand out.
- What if some of her incarnations are in some kind of relationship (romance, close friendship, mentorship) with someone? Might she feel conflicted, as her different selves go in different emotional directions?

## Rogue's Gallery

- The Fractal will go up against some heavy hitters, sooner or later. Do they have an adversarial relationship, built on hate and disgust? Or is she trying to help them, and how receptive are they to help?
- A hero's rogues often learn their secrets, sooner or later. What would her rogues do with hers - try to out her, or keep quiet about what they know, for a day of reckoning?
