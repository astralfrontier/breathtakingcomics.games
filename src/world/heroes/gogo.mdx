# Gogo

Mercenary supervillain Jacques Rabbit stole a batch of super-soldier serum.
He left the most useless vial behind, in teenage delivery driver Robin Rhodes' beat-up car.
Robin kept it hidden, along with the notes from the lab on what it included.
The moment where a supervillain had come into an otherwise boring life was exciting beyond description.
And when it was over... That boredom and craving for excitement drove Robin to drink the serum - and change.

The combination of galago, axolotl, and wrasse DNA did more than give Robin the ability to turn into a furry human-galago hybrid with amazing reflexes.
It means that Robin can switch between male and female bodies.
And worse, the unstable nature of the serum means that sometimes, Robin will switch whether he/she wants to or not.

Robin consults with the school's chemistry teacher, Dr. Emilio Blasto, for help in controlling the transformations, and for ideas on what to do with this power.
He/she fears that Jacques Rabbit may learn about the use of the serum and come for the Rhodes family.
But mostly, Robin is overjoyed that life can be so much fun now.

Note: Robin has embraced his/her shifts and goes by appropriate pronouns when in an appropriate form.

# Drives

- Outmaneuver an enemy with grace and style
- Calm endangered civilians by being a furry friend
- Impress or charm a teammate

# Panels

In their transformed state, Gogo uses their immensely powerful leg muscles
to bounce from surface to surface - walls, moving buses, even flagpoles -
as they spring across the city at amazing speed!

Gogo's large ears and other hyper-senses pick up on an incoming attack before it happens,
and they dodge nimbly out of the way with a witty quip.

Robin is at school, playing basketball.
Their hormones and impulses run high, maybe from the game itself, maybe from someone watching them play.
Feeling the change happen, they run off the court, shouting that they have an injury
and are heading for the infirmary.

# Variations

## The Shifts

- The super-soldier serum Robin used turns the user into a human-animal hybrid, with the best qualities of the animal DNA.
  For Robin, that includes an occasional sex shift. If that's too much for the story, give Robin an assigned gender and remove it.
- You can also introduce other animal DNA, perhaps giving Robin an option to shift into more than just a human-galago form, perhaps with other strengths (and weaknesses).

## The Theft

- Robin worries that Jacques Rabbit might come hunting for him/her. Would that happen?
  Maybe - if the mercenary made a mistake by losing the serum. Or maybe the fear is all in Robin's imagination.
- Maybe it wasn't an accident. Dr. Emilio Blasto, the school's chemist, has been very helpful in assisting Robin...

## Personal Life

- Who knows that Robin can shift sex? How does Robin present at his/her school? Is it the same school he/she used to attend?
- Does Robin have a favorite or preferred form? We haven't stated what Robin was before the serum -
  because it might not matter now, or because one version or another works better for a given story.

# Background

## When did you first put on the mask? Why?

Jacques Rabbit, a human-animal supersoldier turned mercenary supervillain, stole my car one time! He left behind a vial of serum, mixing galago, axolotl, and wrasse DNA. I kept it from the cops, and eventually drank it, turning into a hybrid supersoldier myself!

Why take it? I guess... having my car stolen was so exciting for a few moments, and then after I had to go to the police and do all the boring stuff, it was so DULL. I wanted the excitement I felt then.

## Why do you keep a secret identity?

If Jacques Rabbit ever found out it was me that took the serum, he'd come back and hurt my family! Plus, my little bro Mo gets bullied enough already.

## Who, outside of the team, knows about your dual identity?

I went to the school's chemistry teacher, Dr. Emilio Blasto, for help in controlling my transformations! I had to talk to him about the shifting, and he gave me tips on how to maintain self-control.

## Who thinks the worst of your masked identity?

Aside from Jacques Rabbit, I got spotted as Gogo one time wearing a school jersey, so now the school newspaper thinks they were making fun of the school (our school animal is an Eagle) and constantly writes articles trashing me.

## Why do you care about the team?

The team is a bunch of fun weirdos and I finally have somewhere I can be myself! Whoever that is...
