# Generation Zeta

The team is intended to be tied to the <World id="settings/zeta-city" /> setting, but can be dropped into most superhero settings.

The team's members:

- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/astralis" />, an alien princess trying to avert an invasion of Earth.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/diesel-jenny" />, a regenerating mutant trying to balance identity, duty, and family.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/guardian-ghost" />, the latest in a line of shadow-wielding "Mystery Men".
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/pelagos" />, a two-fisted aquatic archaeologist who wants to prove he's more than his wealth.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/sabine" />, a blind speedster with a love of adventure.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/sprout" />, a size-changing hero from a species of tiny people.

# Playing Generation Zeta

The members of Generation Zeta are young - teenagers or young adults at most.
Each of them is taking steps into an unknown, possibly dangerous world.
As they do, each of them faces some kind of pressure from their family or culture.
Diesel Jenny, Guardian Ghost, Pelagos, and Sabine are under the thumb of their parents.
Astralis and Sprout must contend with a whole culture watching what they do.
Together, they are as much a mutual support network as a super-team dedicated to peace and protection.

The team's power level is moderate.
None of them have devastatingly powerful offensive or defensive abilities, though they can hold their own.
Individual members can operate in a variety of regimes (space, underwater, tiny places...).
When confronting a particularly powerful enemy, their best options are teamwork and the exploitation of an enemy's flaws.
They'd be challenged to stop a large-scale natural disaster, but would be good at rescuing civilians as part of a larger such effort.
