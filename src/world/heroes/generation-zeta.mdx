# Generation Zeta

The team is intended to be tied to the <World id="settings/zeta-city" /> setting, but can be dropped into most superhero settings.

The team's members:

- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/astralis" />, an alien princess trying to avert an invasion of Earth.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/diesel-jenny" />, a regenerating mutant trying to balance identity, duty, and family.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/guardian-ghost" />, the latest in a line of shadow-wielding "Mystery Men".
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/pelagos" />, a two-fisted aquatic archaeologist who wants to prove he's more than his wealth.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/sabine" />, a blind speedster with a love of adventure.
- <World id="heroes/generation-zeta/sprout" />, a size-changing hero from a species of tiny people.

The members of Generation Zeta are young - teenagers or young adults at most.
The team's power level is moderate.
None of them have devastatingly powerful offensive or defensive abilities, though they can hold their own.
Individual members can operate in a variety of regimes (space, underwater, tiny places...).
When confronting a particularly powerful enemy, their best options are teamwork and the exploitation of an enemy's flaws.
They'd be challenged to stop a large-scale natural disaster, but would be good at rescuing civilians as part of a larger such effort.

# Playing Generation Zeta

Each member of the team is taking steps into an unknown, possibly dangerous world.
As they do, each of them faces some kind of pressure from their family or culture.
Diesel Jenny, Guardian Ghost, Pelagos, and Sabine are under the thumb of their parents.
Astralis and Sprout must contend with a whole culture watching what they do.
Together, they are as much a mutual support network as a super-team dedicated to peace and protection.

# Variations

## Leadership

- Who leads the team?
  Whoever it is should be tied to how the world views the team:
  somewhere between a sanctioned young-heroes team working with the authorities
  and a renegade band of vigilantes.
- Guardian Ghost's leadership makes the team legit. He's the scion of a famous hero and has connections to match.
- Diesel Jenny being in charge would make the team more independent, able to make its own decisions
  and even defy the authorities if it could show that its play was the right one in due course.
- Under Sabine's leadership, the team would definitely take a rebellious bent,
  doing right no matter what the adults said.
- Pelagos and Sprout are unlikely to be in charge due to their personalities and (in Sprout's case) lack of familiarity with the Giants' world.
- Astralis is also unlikely to lead due to the enforced secrecy around her origins.
  If she shared her secret, however, the team would probably become much more focused on her goals if she became leader.
