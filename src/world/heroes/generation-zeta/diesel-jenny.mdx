{frontmatter.name} is a member of <World id="heroes/generation-zeta" />.

Jenny Arkwright was born with a different name, but only her
industrialist father and his business associates still use it.
She was also born with two connected mutant abilities:
fast physical regeneration, and a mysterious bioelectric power.

Her mother died when Jenny was young,
leaving her father to raise her himself.
Dad uses Jenny as his conduit to young, hip influencers and the kids of prospective investors.
Both her father and her powers keep Jenny from medically transitioning
the way she'd like, though he otherwise seems to accept
her as she knows herself to be.

For Jenny, life is a constant balance.
She wants to be recognized for who she is.
Thanks to her regenerative powers, HRT take effect in minutes rather than months
and her muscles will build like they're being exercised at the same prodigious rate.
To her great displeasure, such things wear off just as quickly.
Somehow, her body knows what it's "supposed" to look like,
and her powers reset it to that baseline.

She's convinced that mastering her powers will let her
change the template her body must use to rebuild her.
And she wants her father to stop treating her as a gender she's not,
just to be his business ambassador to a bunch of misogynist rich kids' scions.
Her father does important and valuable work -
his products and processes feed, clothe, and support millions around the world.
This alone keeps her cooperating with his requests, at least for the moment.

It's only when she puts on a mask and costume,
and prowls the streets to throw herself between attackers and their victims,
that Jenny feels like she's unmasking her real self.
She'll make her own choices, express her own desires, and even save some lives along the way.
That's who she is, and neither her family nor her body can say she's wrong.

# Playing {frontmatter.name}

Jenny spends life in two very different worlds - as an accessory to her father's benevolent
industrial empire, and as a down-and-dirty front-line fighter on the city's streets.
Her motivation is **to find balance at the center of her chaotic life**.

Diesel Jenny is inspired by characters such as Marvel's **X-23**,
with a background similar to the X-Men's **Angel**.

## Plots

- Throw down against a violent, powerful villain or a gang of dangerous hoodlums
- Get involved in a messy, dangerous rescue operation
- Investigate shenanigans involving one of her father's business partners

## Dialogue

> "You wanna talk about dysphoria? I lost a hand once. It _came back_. Like, fucking _how_?
> Where did the mass come from? It's not like I suddenly got hungry, it was just, _bam_! Creepy."
>
> "I can heal from anything except how bad that outfit looks on you. Big yikes."
>
> "There's a lot of things I've never done. Never ate dim sum. Never drove a bus.
> And I ain't never, ever given up."

## Comic Book Panels

Diesel Jenny grabs hold of people and hugs them tight to her,
just as gunmen open fire! Bullets strike her back, and blood spurts out,
but the holes close up almost as fast as they're made.
As they reload, she rises, angrily, clenching her fists.

Jenny is on the way to rescue people from a bus on fire!
She smashes through the front glass window, cutting herself and healing just as fast.
She forces the bus door open, shouting at the people to hurry and leave,
wincing in pain as a spreading fire starts to burn her as well.

Jenny has taken a dose of her medication,
and watches herself in the mirror as her body resculpts itself under the drug's influence.
She quickly tries on variations of her costume, as well as cute civilian clothes,
taking mental notes and admiring what she sees.

# Variations

## Jenny's Father

- A large part of Jenny's stress is that her father does good work, and she can help him do much more of it,
  but at the cost of how she presents herself.
- Why doesn't her father accept her more openly? And has he explained his reasons?
  "I want connections with people who won't accept you as a girl" is only Jenny's assumption.
  Answering this question can change their relationship significantly.
- What if her father is less benevolent than he seems?
  This actually makes Jenny's personal life easier - she need no longer pretend when she attends his business functions -
  but would also forces her to fight her only surviving parent.
