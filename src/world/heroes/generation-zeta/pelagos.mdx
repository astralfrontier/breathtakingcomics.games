Ricky Cleveland was born blessed and cursed.
Cursed, by having a rare genetic disorder that threatened his life.
Blessed, by having parents with both money and underworld connections.
They got in touch with some folks who had access to stolen biomedical hyper-technology.

The operation did more than save Ricky's life.
It stabilized what was killing him - latent hydrokinetic powers,
or the ability to manipulate water.
The human body is almost 70% water, after all.
Without the treatment, those out-of-control abilities would have torn him apart.

With his newly stabilized powers,
Ricky discovered that he could swim underwater at great speed,
breathe in water as easily as air,
and even survive the crushing depths of the ocean.
What he found in his explorations were shipwrecks - everything from
modern container ships to ancient galleons loaded with European gold.
By pulling up what was valuable, or exploring what was interesting,
he was able to bring in more money than his parents ever had.

Was this how he wanted to repay the gift of life?
Was his newfound independent wealth going to attract scrutiny,
and discover the crime that saved his life?
He couldn't do much. He couldn't summon water out of nowhere,
cause tsunamis, or even affect the water in others' bodies - just his own.

Ricky took the alias "Pelagos", and decided to become a superhero.
He had money - but he wanted to be valued for himself and his own contributions,
not just be used as a super-team's ATM.
He could swim, but so what? What did he really have to offer?
He could use his powers to move his body, making him an effective physical fighter.
He might be out of his depth, but he was going to sink or swim.

# Playing {frontmatter.name}

Pelagos wants to make up for his parents' use of black-market technology
to save his life, and make something of himself beyond being "the rich kid".
His motivation is **to serve a greater, more noble cause**.

That said, his money is an important consideration.
He effectively has a monopoly on underwater archaeology,
and he can buy a lot of stuff that any team might need.
It's a sore spot with him, because he doesn't want to be reduced to that,
but he'll do it in a flash.

Pelagos is inspired by Marvel's **Miles Morales aka Spider-Man**
and DC's aquatic hero **Kaldur'ahm aka Aqualad**,
as well as the pulp archaeology hero himself, **Indiana Jones**.

## Plots

- Thwart a major crime near, or in, a major body of water such as piracy
- Get entangled with underworld sources his parents know about
- Get involved in globe-trotting Indiana Jones-style adventurers against
  rogue archaeologists, crime syndicates, and fascists

## Dialogue

> "I'm a simple guy. I see a masked goon stealing medicine from a local hospital, I punch him."
>
> "Something seems fishy about this. No? Damn. Nobody's got a sense of humor here."
>
> "I've seen the wrecks myself, with my own eyes. People sailed these old ships, crossed the ocean,
> knowing they might die, not knowing if they'll see their family again. What an adventure!"

## Comic Book Panels

Pelagos charges forward, through a pack of adversaries.
He ducks and weaves, using his powers to animate his body with impossible fluidity
and power. He throws punch after punch, connecting with jaws and the solar plexus,
knocking his adversaries away.

Pelagos is in the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean.
He holds a light source nearby. Inches from his body, incredible oceanic pressures threaten
to crush him in an instant. He reads the inscription on an ancient treasure,
thought lost at sea, and his eyes gleam with excitement.

The rest of the team has caused a ton of collateral damage,
and are looking embarrassed and worried as city authorities chew them out.
Regretfully, Pelagos pulls a black-and-gold credit card from his pocket and presents it.

# Background

## How did you gain your skills?

I was modified by illegal underground technology in an attempt to save my life by my wealthy parents.
As a result, I was infused with superior physical attributes and "hydrokinesis":
the ability to manipulate, or partially become, water!

## When did you first put on your costume?

I wear the costume to hide my identity, so that my parents don't get in trouble.
They loved their son enough to save his life, and I have to repay that by keeping their secret.

## Who, outside of the team, thinks you shouldn't be a superhero?

My parents frown on my existence as a superhero, wanting me to stay home in safety and be their son.
At the same time, they fear the authorities will learn about the operation that saved my life,
and come down on them. For that reason, I tell stories about "mutation" and leave it at that.

## Why do you try to be a hero?

I started using my powers to explore underwater ruins, shipwrecks, anything else interesting,
and what I came up with allowed me to become independently wealthy.
But I realized what that money was really good for - saving lives, like my parents had done.
Why should I be the only beneficiary of this tech and these abilities?

## Beacon Moves

**Straight. Up. Creepin'**

**Money is my Superpower**

When you drop loads of cash, roll +Superior.
On a 10+, hold 3, on a 7-9, hold 2: on a miss, hold 1,
but you're tapped out for the adventure and face financial complication.
Spend Hold 1-for-1 to:
- Earn the temporary obedience of someone motivated by cash;
- Get access to somewhere off limits;
- Gain something that doesn't require a security clearance.
  (Spend another hold to grease the right palms and get your hands on something you really shouldn't).

# Variations

## Underworld Connections

- Ricky's family is stated to have underworld connections, but what and why?
- They might just be connected the same way as anyone with wealth, but themselves be legitimate.
  There might be a Javert-like cop who's on the case,
  and who could threaten Ricky's parents (or Ricky) with jail time or worse if the truth comes out.
- Alternatively, Ricky's parents might actually be part of a crime syndicate!
  In this case, it'd bring Ricky and his fellow heroes into conflict with his parents.
