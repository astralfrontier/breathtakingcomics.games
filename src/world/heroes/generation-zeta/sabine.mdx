{frontmatter.name} is a member of <World id="heroes/generation-zeta" />.

Once upon a time, a curious girl named Mia Duson went on an adventure.
There was a super-battle, involving the attempted theft of some dangerous chemicals,
and she wanted to see what happened.
She got too close to some of the leftover stuff.
The mutagenic properties of the chemicals changed her,
and she stumbled home blind.

Over time, she realized that in place of her sight,
she'd gained the ability to sense vibrations around her.
It wasn't echolocation - she didn't need to screech like a bat or anything -
but what she felt moved at the speed of sound.
She calls using this sense "rezzing", and she's become quite good at it.

Soon, she discovered she could _manipulate_ vibrations.
She could move at incredible speeds, fly, shake objects apart with vibration,
and much more.
But her reliance on her vibration sense meant that the faster she moved,
the harder it would be to sense where she was going,
or what was ahead of her.
This meant that the faster she moved, the riskier it was.
But that was just fine with an adventurous girl like Mia.

In her personal life, Mia had to make adjustments to her new status quo.
She keeps her powers secret, and because of this can't explain
to people that she can navigate just fine through crowds.
It rankles her when people seem to show pity or excessive accommodation.
What most offends her is the idea of people putting her in any kind of box.
She can do without her sight, but never without her freedom.

# Playing {frontmatter.name}

Sabine's most defining quality is her defiant, passionate verve.
Her motivation is **to savor the experiences of life, risks be damned**.
She's not ignorant of life's darker sides by any means.
She's clever and educated -
she takes her name from [Wallace Clement Sabine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Clement_Sabine),
an inventor in the field of acoustics, for example.

Sabine is inspired by **Toph Bei Fong** from "Avatar: the Last Airbender",
with an origin story and powers also inspired by **Daredevil**.

## Plots

- Meddle with the lives and loves of friends and allies
- Go on an adventure to a dangerous area
- Push back against people trying to lay down limits

## Dialogue

> "Listen, I think you two would be so cute together. Just go talk to him!"
>

>
> "For the last time, I do not need your help. Is there an echo in here?"

## Comic Book Panels

Sabine, hovering in the air opposite a powerful supervillain,
perceives the villain via her rezzing as a silhouette outlined against empty sky.
She can sense his arm raising to unleash a bolt of energy,
and evades it at the speed of sound.

Sabine lets forth a huge wall of solid sound,
blasting a group of henchmen and causing them to drop their weapons in shock.

Mia, in civilian garb and wearing stylish sunglasses, is walking and talking with a friend of hers.
A would-be purse snatcher or pervert approaches the friend from behind,
and without missing a beat, Mia pops the guy in the face before he can even lay a hand on her friend.

# Background

## How did you get your powers?

I was exploring the site of a major super-battle
where the bad guys had tried to steal some volatile chemicals.
I was curious, okay?!
I found what I was looking for.

I stumbled out of the area blinded.
It took awhile for my vibration sense to kick in.

## What do you do for fun?

I mess with my friends' lives, try to set up cute couples,
and just generally make things better for people when they refuse to do it themselves.
Everyone's so cautious all the time! I realize that accidents can happen - I'm an example of one -
but at the same time, nothing lasts forever.

## Who, outside the team, thinks better of you than you do?

Dr. Cross, the medical expert who monitors cases like me.
He's ridiculously kind, even I'm put off by it.

## Why do you try to be a hero?

You know, everyone's so afraid of everything all the time,
they need to wake up and realize that life's better than they think.
It's okay to explore, even if sometimes you get hurt. Break outta your shells, people!

## Why do you care about the team?

The truth I'll never tell is that I want an audience for how cool I am,
and these losers are pretty cool too - they just need to stop being so dour and serious.

# Variations

## The Accident

- Sabine gained her powers through an accidental chemical exposure.
  What if it wasn't purely accidental?
- She might have been lured to the site, like many other people,
  so the chemical's makers could test it on humans, and she was the only
  person brave enough to appear.
- Alternatively, she could have been exposed to something - strange
  chemicals or weird energies - _during_ a super-battle.
