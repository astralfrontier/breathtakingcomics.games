As far as anyone knows, a Japanese girl named Setsujoku Hisako
lives alone with no clear source of income.
Coincidentally, there is a hero named Astralis who uses enigmatic and advanced technology -
an ultra-advanced nanotechnology called "dynamatter" - to fight crime.

The reality is that Astralis is a princess from an interstellar empire.
The complication is that the empire invaded Earth a generation ago.
During that invasion, human heroes stole the Scepter of Rulership from Astralis' parent(s).
Without that Scepter, Astralis cannot ascend to the throne.
If she cannot become the new Empress, the empire's nobles will demand a second invasion of Earth.
And Astralis will be forced to lead it.

Astralis is actually sort of fond of Earth, though she'll never ever admit it.
She's accompanied by Werulf, a canine-like humanoid who serves as her bodyguard,
and is advised by a Chancellor of the empire.
She lives aboard a cloaked ship in orbit around Earth,
and uses her advanced tech to sustain her human identity and equip herself for crimefighting.

Astralis thinks she can't reveal to anyone that she's one of humanity's enemies.
She can't risk losing her teammates and the people she can't admit are her friends.
There's too much riding in the balance, and she can't afford a mistake.

# Playing {frontmatter.name}

Astralis is under tremendous pressure. Her motivation is **to retrieve the Scepter and save the Earth**.
Anything else is secondary in her eyes.
She works as a human hero to pierce the veils of the superhero world,
and interrogates villains to learn what they know as well.
She can't pursue her goals at top speed all the time, though she certainly tries.
Sooner or later, she'll need support - and to get that, she may need to risk sharing her own secrets.

## Plots

- Learn more about a hero who might have taken the Scepter
- Bargain with a villain for knowledge of human heroes
- Work to keep the secret origin of her tech and identity under wraps

## Dialogue

> "If you met your worst enemy, could you forgive them?"
>
> "My technology? It was invented by my father. Yes. My father. Who is an inventor."
>
> "I enjoy several hobbies." (pause) "Such as shopping. And soccer."

## Comic Book Panels

Astralis gestures, and hidden dynamatter reserves engulf her body in powerful glowing armor.
She immediately is hit with a powerful attack, but her armor lets her shrug it off.

The heads-up display (HUD) in Astralis' field of vision lights up,
answering a mental question she has about Earth life and culture such as "what is a hot dog?"
Its answers are always correct, but comically serious.

Astralis sits alone, scrolling through a database of hero names.
Her eyes are narrowed, and she bites her lip in frustration and confusion.
"I just have to get it, and then go... home," she tells herself,
not sure where 'home' really is for her.

# Background

## When did you first learn of your doom?

The Princess Astralis is due to inherit the throne of a space empire.
There's just one problem.
When her royal parent(s) tried conquering Earth,
human heroes drove them back and stole the Scepter of Rulership.

## Where did you get your sanctuary?

The royal Chancellor sent Astralis to Earth with a loyal bodyguard, Werulf,
and a small starship with cloaking technology.
Using any more of the empire's resources would both galvanize the nobles,
and risk Earthlings learning who Astralis really is.

## Why do you oppose your nemesis?

Astralis is pursuing someone she calls "The Thief":
whoever took the Scepter and is now holding onto it.
Without the Scepter, the empire's nobility will demand a new invasion of Earth to retrieve it.
If that happens, Astralis will be forced to lead the invasion.

## Who, outside of the team, is crucial to defeating your nemesis?

Astralis has made contact with a well-known veteran villain, <World id="villains/mr-big" />.
She needs to know everything about Earth's heroes, and the real identity of "The Thief".

# The Doomed

**Hero Name**: Astralis  
**Real Name**: Setsujoku Hisako (first name Hisako)  
**Look**: woman, Asian, empty eyes, adaptive clothing, adaptive costume  
**Abilities**: The princess's high-tech supplies her with hard-light armor and tools,
granting Telekinesis, Superhuman Strength and Speed, and Psychic Constructs. It also provides her with a mundane costume.

**Labels**: Danger -1, Freak +1, Savior +2, Superior +0, Mundane +1

**When our team first came together**: We paid a high cost for victory. What was it?

TBD

**Relationships**:

- You told TBD all about your doom and the danger you're in
- You'd love to kiss TBD before your doom comes

**Influence**: Give two teammates influence

**Nemesis**: The adult heroes of Earth attacked her father.
She must find out who led the attack, and why, and retrieve the scepter from them.

**Doom**: Astralia's Chancellor and bodyguard are overprotective,
and wary of giving away her true identity.
Facing danger alone, and talking about it openly, bring her doom closer.

**Doomsigns**: The princess's ship provides an emergency teleport service,
but this risks discovery, granting her **Portal**.

**Sanctuary**: the spaceship provides the following services:
an aide or assistant; a teleportal; and a powerful computer.
It is difficult to access, and tied intricately to her doom.

# Variations

## The Thief

- The identity of "the Thief" is the biggest pivot point for Astralis' mission.
- It could be a major, well-known hero. Such a person might be reluctant to return the Scepter,
  but could be persuaded if Astralis is sincere.
- What if it's an elusive, secretive hero - a Batman type instead of Superman?
  It might be incredibly difficult to find such a person, much less persuade them.
- What if the Thief _was_ a hero, but has _become_ a villain?

## The Invasion Timeline

- How long does Astralis have before the invasion is due to commence?
  It could be years - or it could be months.
- The shorter the time period, the more the story will necessarily revolve around Astralis,
  because she disappears as a protagonist (or rebels against her people) once the clock ticks down.
- What happens if the invasion actually happens?
