# Handmaid

Handmaid is a one-trick pony among villain gadgeteers.
Other inventors build everything from force fields to mechanical T-rexes to power armor.
Handmaid has one gimmick, but she's really good at it. She builds robot hands.

The hands are clearly robotic.
They have four fingers and a thumb, articulated like a human's hand.
Individual hands can come with variations, such as video cameras, hooks for snapping on cables, and so on.
They're able to move independently by using their fingers as legs, and can throw each other around.
Some individual hands might express some rudimentary personality, as their AI becomes more specialized over time.

Handmaid's goal is to prove herself to someone more senior in the villain community.
She can be useful, and can carry off capers on her own, but she wants to make it big.
Her biggest limitation right now is herself.
She either can't or won't invent anything new, preferring to develop newer and better iterations of her one creation.
She's otherwise a cheerful, energetic young woman who knows who and what she wants to be, and is out to go make it happen.

# Drives (for heroes)

- Stop Handmaid from commiting a solo caper
- Make Handmaid look bad in front of a big villain
- Recover something her handbots stole

# Moves

- Swarm the area with an army of handbots
- Reveal a handbot anywhere the heroes don't want or expect it
- Escape the scene with a helping hand

# Variations

## Employment

- Handmaid could make a great lieutenant for a villain, and might be one already! Who is she working for?
- Alternatively, maybe Handmaid burned some bridges or messed up badly,
  and is trying to rehabilitate herself to a community of villains who don't trust her.

## Hands' Handiness

- The hands might be unique creations with a bunch of minor gadgets built in, like tasers or rockets.
  This gives Handmaid more options, and turns the hands from a limitation into more of a theme for her inventions.
- Alternatively, her handbots are all built the same way, but they can have strength in numbers.
  Hundreds of identical handbots might overwhelm heroes, barricade doors, or sabotage machines.
