# Captain Burger

Captain Burger's signature sandwich are a rite of passage for young people in the city.
They're super-salty, super-savory, and super-greasy.
They will, as the adults say, “stunt your growth”.
For close to $20, you get a burger wrapped in paper with the Captain Burger mascot (“saving you from hunger!”),
on a cheap non-stick aluminum tray.
You also get fries.
Condiments, napkins, and soda drinks are over there - serve yourself.
You pay your money, get a burger, eat it, and then try to survive the next 12 hours.
It is the purest essence of the American fast food experience.

Captain Burger is for...

- Heroes who want a place to hang out and unwind between missions
- Heroes with secret identities who need a part-time job

# Drives (for heroes)

- Keep Captain Burger from being destroyed by the current crisis
- Meet friends at Captain Burger and relax
- Survive your first Captain Burger experience
