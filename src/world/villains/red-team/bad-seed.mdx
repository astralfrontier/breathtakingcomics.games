# Bad Seed

<em>{frontmatter.description}</em>

> "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm gonna love defeating you."

Bad Seed is a member of <World id="villains/red-team" />.
On the team, she uses her mastery of plant life to create shields and structures.

Nobody's quite sure why Bad Seed is a villain.
She has no track record of villainous activities or arrests before being added to Red Team.
At first, her teammates assumed she was a "plant" (haha) - a mole, or a traitor, or _something_.
But she didn't hesitate when it came time to get her hands dirty.
Eventually, they shrugged and went with it.

Bad Seed can control the growth of plant life, even from a seed.
She carries around a seed bag containing useful specimens from around the world.
If she should be deprived of her seed supply, well, existing plants are everywhere.
Even weeds will grow at the center of a concrete metropolis.

Like weeds, Bad Seed is hard to put down.
She can disappear into a thicket of brambles instantly,
or take cover behind an impenetrable barrier of hardwood trees.
She's able to move effortlessly through her creations,
as they bend and twist to support or shield her.

Offensively, there's nothing stopping her from growing plants that produce poisons,
or filling an area with mold spores or something.
As a person, she seems to lack any kind of real malice.

# Playing Bad Seed

To everyone else, Bad Seed's reasons for villainy are unclear.
Her most obvious motivation as a character is **to follow along with her team's direction**.
But what's really going on?

## Plots

- Keep Bad Seed from bringing down an important building, such as a bank or police station
- Prevent Bad Seed from obtaining seeds for a particularly dangerous plant
- Investigate Bad Seed's past and personal life

## Dialogue

> "Thorns are the reasons roses can keep growing."
>
> "Did you know the Lignum Vitae tree can resist the impact of a car at full speed?"
>
> "Watermelons? These are melons. Water chestnuts? These are chestnuts."

## Comic Book Panels

In the basement of a building, Bad Seed creates fast-growing kudzu or bamboo,
along with vines to grow up and out.
She follows this with fast-growing trees like the Sequoia.
In moments, the building is being broken apart from the inside and ready to collapse.

Bad Seed crouches atop a pack of fast-growing giant vines,
which snake their way across the battlefield.
As attacks come in, she shields herself behind tree trunks that sprout up in seconds.

Bad Seed fills the air with pollen and spores,
blocking vision and creating a choking hazard.
People who charge through the cloud without checking
will impale themselves on endless sharp thorns.

# Variations

## The Mystery

- So what's the deal? There is one, but what?
  The rest of Red Team might be right, and Bad Seed could be put on the team by whoever runs it.
- Alternatively, Bad Seed could be here for some kind of personal reasons.
  Maybe she didn't go along with the plans of whoever runs Red Team, and this is her punishment.
- Maybe she wants revenge on someone, either on Red Team or someone Red Team will go up against,
  and she's biding her time.
