# Hannibal Lectric

<em>{frontmatter.description}</em>

> "Worthy challengers? I feel galvanized!"

Hannibal Lectric is a member of <World id="villains/red-team" />.
On the team, he acts as the unofficial team leader, coordinating the actions of the others and devising strategies.

Hannibal Lectric is many things: a master supervillain; a backstabbing bastard; an honorable gentleman and man of learning; a patron of the arts, but also a black-hearted scoundrel.
With his electrical powers, he accelerates his mind and body to become a genius and man of action, able to effortlessly crush unprepared heroes.
At the same time, he craves recognition for his superiority, and will leave defeated foes alive to tell stories of their encounters with him.

As an independent criminal, Hannibal preferred sophisticated criminal capers.
He would never stoop to anything as common as a bank robbery.
Indeed, he has been known to occasionally aid the police when an associate of his embarrasses him through such actions.
He likes the high life and will surround himself with art, culture, and literate companions whenever possible - even if they must be threatened into it.

Hannibal can be pushed too far.
When accelerating his nerves, he risks burning out his brain and straining his muscles, and he has been manipulated into doing just this by canny superheroes.
If he can be tricked into trying too hard to prove himself superior, his own powers become his downfall.

# Playing Hannibal Lectric

Hannibal Lectric fancies himself a man of culture and refinement, and he is. His motivation is **to enjoy the finest parts of life**, even if he has to steal them.

As a member of Red Team, he is likeliest to chafe at his restraints, and will plot ways to escape.
But while he's part of the team, he'll take his pleasures from the life he's been forced to lead.
He enjoys artifacts of high culture such as famous books, fine dining, and classical concerts.

Hannibal Lectric is of course inspired by Hannibal Lector, the crual but sophisticated killer from "Silence of the Lambs".
His comic-book inspiration is the Starman villain **the Shade**.

## Dialogue

> "As Hegel said, 'To be aware of limitations is already to be beyond them.' You are clearly not aware of yours."
>
> "You heroes always seem eager to senselessly sacrifice yourselves. Allow me to accept your offer."
>
> "Ah, I see. The brightest bulb burns out the fastest."

## Comic Book Panels

Hannibal Lectric is surrounded by sparks and surges of electricity, as he amplifies his body and mind to superhuman levels.
He sprints forward, mentally prepared for anything.

A hero throws a punch. Hannibal Lectric catches it in a grappling counter-move,
then electrifies the hero in a single powerful pulse.

Hannibal Lectric blasts out electronic locks, security systems, and other vulnerable machinery in an area.
He strides confidently past the smoking wreck of the systems meant to keep him out.

# Variations

## Power Flavor

- Hannibal Lectric is effectively a low-level speedster.
  He can make both his body and mind move faster, but risks burning himself out if he pushes too hard.
  Control over electricity is how this power works.
- Some versions of the villain might lean into other applications of the lightning power,
  turning him into a version of Marvel's Electro, for example.
  Ultimately, his powers should focus on making him a better version of himself.
