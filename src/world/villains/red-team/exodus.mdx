# Exodus

<em>{frontmatter.description}</em>

> "Ka chow! It's ya boy, Exodus, back at it again! Let's play!"

Exodus is a member of <World id="villains/red-team" />.
On the team, he provides transportation to or from the center of action.
In battle, he mostly harasses the opposition and goes after objectives.

Exodus, aka Ernest Elvin, is irresponsible, careless, and thoughtless.
He has the ultimate Get Out of Jail card: teleportation.
Barring special circumstances, He can escape from anything, consequence free.
He can steal what he likes.
But since everything's within reach, he doesn't hoard.
He's not greedy, just without any notion of personal property.
He'll as readily give something back as take it.

He drifts through life and does whatever feels right at the moment.
He's not the violent sort, but will fight in self-defense or when ordered to by a sufficiently assertive team leader.
The authorities want him locked up mostly on principle,
and partly for some very expensive pranks he's pulled on them.
Until Red Team, he was thought to be impossible to restrain for very long.

That trait also works against him.
Because he can always run, he's had very few reasons in life to stand and fight.
He wants respect, admiration, approval, love, sex, whatever people will offer him,
but even a moderate amount of resistance will make him back off.
He may steal from someone, but he won't assault them.

# Playing Exodus

Exodus has the power to literally avoid responsibility.
If someone hassles him, he can always leave.
His motivation is simply **to have fun and indulge himself**.
He isn't mean-spirited or abusive with his powers.
Why should he be?
The grass is always greener on the other side, and he can switch sides at will.

Exodus is a villainous take on goofball speedsters like **The Flash (Wally West)**.

## Plots

- Defend a person or place from Exodus' shenanigans until he's beaten or gets bored and leaves
- Get something important or expensive back from Exodus
- Try out a new anti-teleportation gimmick to capture Exodus

## Comic Book Panels

The other members of his team are eagerly counting the money they received from robbing a bank.
Exodus is carelessly tossing money around in a downtown area,
while simultaneously stealing interesting things that catch his eye.

Exodus is holding onto a falling teammate.
They have plenty of built-up downward momentum - so he teleports with them, emerging upside down.
The momentum is now pointed _upward_, counteracting gravity.
Step by step, he neutralizes the effects of the fall on his friend.

Exodus is gleefully dodging gunfire from a bunch of soldiers.
He can move from cover to cover without exposing himself to danger.
Every so often, someone tosses a grenade his way,
but he teleports it 180 degrees, thus tossing it back at the thrower.

# Variations

## Teleportation's Limitations

- As with super-speed, teleportation can be potentially very powerful.
  As a life-long teleporter, Exodus has psychological limits on its worst misuses.
- The specifics on what teleportation can do will largely determine how dangerous he is as a villain.
  He probably can't teleport parts of a person away, for example.
- Can he steal things people are holding or carrying?
  Can he teleport someone into the air, then drop them?
  What do people _think_ or _fear_ he can do?
