# Overreach

<em>{frontmatter.description}</em>

> "Another challenger? Very well! Come die on my blades."

Overreach is a member of <World id="villains/red-team" />.
On the team, she is a versatile and dangerous enemy, both up close and at range.

Overreach can manipulate any part of her body, stretching up to hundreds of meters in length at her maximum.
She can wield her limbs like whips, extend or retract them at great speed, and - worst -
_compress_ parts of herself into almost two-dimensional slices.

Her power lets her zip from point to point around a battlefield by extending an arm, grabbing hold of something,
and pulling herself up.
Like a squid, she can squish herself down to squeeze through tiny gaps.
She can compress arms or individual fingers along a single dimension,
turning them into razor-sharp claws or blades.
While exerting her powers, her body gains the properties of a non-Newtonian fluid,
making her highly resistant to gunfire and other impacts.

Overreach has no long-term goals or grand plans for world domination.
She simply enjoys inflicting pain and terror on anyone who stands up to her.
When she fights, she has a cruel smile on her face,
and her eyes light up with a twisted joy.

Somehow, somewhere, Overreach clearly received dance training.
When she moves, it's with a balletic grace. 
She's light on her feet, and her movements are intentional but economical.
There's a distinct contrast between the beauty of her performance and her wicked personality.

Because her clothes do not stretch with her, she wears a loosely fitting shift dress.
She neither needs nor uses other kinds of equipment.

# Playing Overreach

Overreach is a selfish and cruel villain. Her motivation is **to glorify herself through displays of power**.
She is clever and cunning, but not particularly refined.
If she can be said to have some redeeming attribute, it's that she will never hurt the helpless.
If you show resistance, you're fair game.

## Plots

- Stop Overreach from hurting people during one of her rampages
- Protect someone Overreach has challenged to a battle to the death
- Rescue an enemy Overreach has taken captive

## Dialogue

> "I may not be an intellectual, but you'll soon find out how sharp I can be."
>
> "You think you can 'redeem' me? I'm not a coupon, you arrogant ass."
>
> "I cannot be disarmed or 'pacified'. I am all the weapon I will ever need."

## Comic Book Panels

Under attack, Overreach swings between walls and ceilings, grabbing hold of whatever protrusion presents itself.
She stretches an arm and swings it around like a whip, knocking a tight-knit group of attackers to the ground.

Overreach compresses one hand into an ultra-thin blade,
then chops through an enemy soldier's assault rifle as they try to block with it.
The rifle breaks into two pieces, with bits of metal raining out.

While escaping enemies, Overreach comes to a locked door with a mailbox slot, air vent, or some other tiny gap.
She squeezes through the gap, eluding her pursuers.

# Variations

## Sympathy

- Should anyone care about Overreach, or is she thoroughly a villain who's best kept away from common humanity?
  Her dance moves make it clear she has some capacity to create beauty.
  But this need not make her a less cruel person by nature.
- It's possible that she was a past victim of abuse, and is now lashing out at the world for it.
  In such a case, she might target her abusers (or have long since dealt with them).
- Other versions exist, such as having her be the product of some kind of experiment to implant or augment superpowers.
