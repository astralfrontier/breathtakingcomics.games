# Red Team

The team's members:

- <World id="villains/red-team/hannibal-lectric" />, the nomimal leader. He uses electric powers to accelerate his mind and body.

In the security world, a "red team" is a group that pretends to go after an objective,
in order to assess and improve the defenses around that objective.
Imagine art thieves hired by the Louvre to test the Mona Lisa's security, and you get the idea.

Members of the villain group known as the Red Team have been told they're on such a group,
funded and organized by a secret government organization.
They've been sent up against different targets, including hero teams,
and let off the hook the times they were defeated.

Is the deal genuine? Or is someone just keeping them out of jail to cause chaos?
They don't know.
All they know is, someone wants people like them on a long leash.

# Playing Red Team

The key to Red Team is **uncertainty**.
They've been told a story by people over the phone.
At the same time, nobody else seems to be in on the stories.
Heroes don't acknowledge them as being on the government's side.
So what's going on?
Should they try escaping their mysterious controllers' grasp?
Can they?
