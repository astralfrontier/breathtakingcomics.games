# Jacques Rabbit

The man now known as Jacques Rabbit was once a member of the Belgian Armed Forces,
and has worked as a special operations soldier in NATO operations.
Because of his excellent record and remarkable physique,
he was chosen as the test subject for a "super soldier" treatment.
Genetic engineering would endow him with the properties of an animal,
allowing him to be stronger, faster, and more cunning.

What nobody outside the research project knew was just *which* animal had been selected...

The tests were successful.
The soldier really was better, faster, and stronger than before.
He was physically capable of amazing feats.
His heightened senses conveyed tremendous battlefield awareness.
He could move by jumping, leaping from rooftop to rooftop and operating with almost-perfect stealth.

The program was cancelled.
Not because it had failed, but because none of the top brass could accept the notion of a long-eared rabbit-man working with their troops.

The man himself, having no place among his former comrades, deserted in despair.
He drifted into mercenary work, making a living through theft and larceny.
In time, he regained his sense of honor and dignity,
worked to establish a reputation for himself as a dependable (if still criminal) mercenary,
and refused jobs which offended his sense of propriety.

Today, Jacques Rabbit will take any job that don't require him to compromise his principles.
He is skilled, competent, and serious about his professionalism.
He refuses to injure the innocent and will insist on getting paid for a job well done.
Woe to any employer who underestimates him - or worse, insults his appearance.

# Panels

A muscular human-rabbit hybrid, dressed in fatigues and body armor and armed with an assault rifle,
leaps from rooftop to rooftop in pursuit of a gang on foot at street level.
With a combination of gunfire and grenades, he herds them into ambush.

Jacques Rabbit dashes through a building, ears constantly twitching in different directions.
He runs like a prey animal avoiding a predator, every move instinctual and graceful.
Bullets and blasts follow him, but nothing touches him.

Jacques Rabbit emerges out of the shadows, having set a trap for the heroes.
He activates a device, slamming shut doors and triggering bombs.
And then, propelled by powerful rabbit leg muscles, he leaps away to safety.

# Variations

## Origin

- How voluntary was the procedure? Jacques Rabbit could have been a volunteer - or he could have been volunteered.
- If it was not his choice, does he hold a grudge against whoever made him this way?
  Does he think another serum might give him a more "acceptable" form?

## Honor Code

- Just what is Jacques Rabbit's code of honor?
  By default, he won't hurt civilians and won't betray his word once given.
  Beyond that, he'll probably hurt whoever and destroy whatever stands in his way.
- He might have other rules, such as not hurting children or teenagers (even teenage superheroes),
  which the heroes can take advantage of.
