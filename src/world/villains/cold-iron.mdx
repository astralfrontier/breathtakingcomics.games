# Cold Iron

<em>{frontmatter.description}</em>

> "Your doom will be beautiful"

Dr. Glenys Price was a notable anthropologist and archaeologist.
She went on several digs, hoping to prove that the "fair folk" - the Tylwyth Teg - were an ancient race of real beings.
While on a dig in the Mirolda gouffre near the Alps, one of the deepest cave systems in the world,
she and her team discovered a cache of sophisticated and ancient armor and weapons.
Dr. Price was ecstatic. This was just what her theory had predicted.

One of the workers accidentally opened a box the team had recovered from the cache.
A very powerful and very evil spirit, the Allochthonus, had been imprisoned there.
Immediately it possessed Dr. Price's body.
The scientist maintained control of her own mind long enough to strap on one of the suits of armor.
If the stories were true, iron should be a deterrent to such creatures.
She was right.
Unfortunately, it wouldn't be enough.

For the next few weeks, Dr. Price worked feverishly to understand her condition.
Allochthonus had to be exorcised, then returned to its prison.
The magical ur-science of the ancient Tylwyth Teg eluded her understanding, and the constant headaches weren't helping.
She needed more - more relics to study, more objects of power to hold back the entity, more books to read.

The armor's technology included shields and wings of hard light,
a "light lance" that could be used for close or ranged combat, and other abilities.
Its arcane senses could detect traps both mystic and mundane.
She didn't *have* to ask. "Just take what you need," a voice in her mind said.
"You can return the relics when you are done. If the Allochthonus escapes, it will be a danger to the entire world. You'd be doing the right thing".
Never guessing that the voice was not her own, she committed the first of many thefts and harmed the first of many people.

Today, Glenys Price is a changed woman.
The Allochthonus' corruption of her mind is almost complete.
Under its spell, she steals magical artifacts and books of sorcerous learning.
She has enhanced her armor with both runic sigils and stolen super-science.
The world knows her as "Cold Iron", a heartless and obsessed super-criminal.
Occasionally she has moments of lucidity and regret, but without aid, she is very close to falling completely.
And should she ever be taken out of the suit without proper safeguards,
the Allochthonus will escape and bring terror to the world again.

# Playing Cold Iron

When in her right mind, Dr. Price's motivation is **to free herself of a cthonic entity's control**.
She could conceivably become a hero, but will be a villain as long as the entity has a hold on her.

She is a mystical variant on Marvel's **Iron Man** - someone whose tech is keeping her alive.

## Plots

- Keep a magical relic or sorcerer's library safe from Cold Iron
- Prevent Cold Iron from enacting a dangerous magical rite
- Help Dr. Price keep control over the Allochthonus

## Dialogue

> "Listen, I've never cast this particular spell before, but if you don't back off, I'm going to have to try it on you"

## Comic Book Panels

A figure descends from the sky, on wings like a butterfly's.
It is graceful and beautiful, enchanting in every sense.
A compelling voice echoes from the armored figure: "withdraw or die. What I seek, I will have."

Sparkles of light accompany energy blasts emanating from Cold Iron's lance.
An enemy attacks, only to be parried by shields of light emanating from her forearms.
She draws a slim, elegant blade and readies it.

The armor's faceplate has opened, and Dr. Price looks out at the heroes.
Half of her face is in light, showing human anger and regret.
The other half of her face is shadowed, and the eye glows with magical might and cunning cruelty.

# Variations

## Folkloric Origins

- The Tylwyth Teg are a specific mythological entity, hailing from Wales or Ireland.
- Any mythology with a similar group of powerful and mysterious beings could be responsible for the armor.
  In this case, the villain's name (which alludes to a specific bit of Fair Folk lore) might change,
  and how her armor and powers manifest will definitely be different.

# Notes

The Tylwyth Teg armor stands nearly six feet tall.
It is self-adjusting and will fit itself to the wearer's body automatically.
Wings of light emerge from the back and legs to allow steering while in flight.
Similar projections emit from the forearms to create solid shields to protect the wearer.
A long lance-shaped weapon is mounted on the back.
It can swivel up to become a shoulder-mounted weapon on either side, or detach and be wielded in one or two hands.

It is white with colored accents, which glow when the suit's powers come into play.
Under normal operation, they would glow forest-green.
When the Allochthonus' influence over Dr. Price is strongest, the green becomes a bloody red hue.
If Dr. Price's will becomes dominant, the color changes to a dark blue.

Out of the armor, Dr. Price stands 5'7".
She has long brunette hair, olive skin, and dark blue eyes.
She is a trained scientist and retains her intellect and curiosity, even as the Allochthonus has dominated her will and twisted her morals.

Deep down, she knows what has happened to her, and she fights with every ounce of strength.
As Cold Iron, she will not kill but will cause harm, and has no compunction about inflicting property damage.

Cold Iron's combat tactics will be straightforward.
Her armor transforms her into a Fair Folk warrior of legend, and she will fight accordingly.
She has no patience or knack for stealth, preferring the direct approach.
That doesn't mean she's predictable - she's formidably intelligent, and should always have a backup plan, surprise, or distraction ready.

If Cold Iron is ever removed from her armor without other sorcerous safeguards,
the spirit inside her can escape - perhaps by possessing someone else.
It has grown strong by feeding on her soul, and will definitely pose a far greater danger than Cold Iron herself.
Freeing her from the Allochthonus is possible, but should be difficult, and will require the aid of a master mystic or powerful creature of magic.
