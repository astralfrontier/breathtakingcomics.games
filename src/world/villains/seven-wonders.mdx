# The Seven Wonders of the Villain World

The team's members:

- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/gnosis" />, a telepathic psychiatrist. He acts as the planner and coordinator for the team. In his secret identity, he is a consulting psychologist specializing in supers.
- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/dsol8" />. an enigmatic cyborg from the future. He is a high-tech combatant, but has his own hidden agenda.
- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/glom" />, a hyperactive kinetic manipulator. She acts as a versatile support, harassing heroes and backing up her teammates.
- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/the-hand" />. TODO
- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/khyrrsz" />, a Neanderthal god of blizzards and battle. They are a brutal physical and mystical powerhouse.
- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/motormouth" />. a fast-talking technopath in the body of a mashed-up robot.
- <World id="villains/seven-wonders/veneer" />, a suave spy who can flatten herself into two dimensions.

The villains operate in groups of two or three at a time.
Their typical operations are complex, well-planned, with multiple objectives and plenty of contingencies.
They steal valuable tech, kidnap experts who can further their goals,
and steal the secrets of the leaders and luminaries of society.

# Variations

## Origin

- Did the Seven Wonders emerge during this generation of heroes?
  Perhaps they started during the last generation, but spent time in stasis or another dimension before returning.
  This would give them a relationship with the PC's mentors and predecessors,
  and give the PCs more knowledge about how to beat them.
- Did Gnosis really unite the team on his own, or was he led to do it (possibly by D-SOL-8)?
  It might be interesting to imagine a villain team that came together as accidentally as a typical group of PC heroes.
