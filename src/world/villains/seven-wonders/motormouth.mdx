  - Oh hey there! So nice to see you. Heroes, right? Gotta love 'em.
    Well, actually, I hate 'em. But you know. We all have a right to change our mind!
  - Want to know more about me? I come from Hackensack, New Jersey.

    How did I get it, I hear myself asking on your behalf? Funny story!

# Motormouth

Motormouth is a member of <World id="villains/seven-wonders" />.

Once upon a time, the villain now calling herself Motormouth was a potent technopath and telekinetic.
She could take control of seemingly any device and bend it to her will.
Her power lets her physically manipulate the metal or plastic of machines as well.

Her great power led to overconfidence.
When she was finally confronted by a band of heroes, rather than fleeing, she overtaxed her powers.
Instead of taking control of the numerous machines at the scene,
her mind was transferred into them.
She became a grotesque melange of every device she had tried to control.

Despite that, she escaped, now in the form of a nine-foot robot built out of spare parts:
bits of automobiles, stoplights, and other machines that had been on the scene.
Sometimes she discards bits of her new body to connect others,
such as weapons or advanced tech.

She abhors her new form, despite the physical power it grants her,
because much of her psychic potential is used to hold her artificial body together.
She's in search of the only prize she thinks is worth having:
restoration to human form, but with all her enormous power restored.
The authorities would greatly prefer she have one but not the other.

Motormouth lives on the edge of terror and frustration.
She compensates with smart remarks, quips, and a chummy attitude toward heroes and civilian victims alike.
She enjoys playing at being friendly.
In truth, her new form has isolated her socially, and she isn't above doing a real good turn for people,
out of a desperate need for some human connection.

As a member of the Seven Wonders,
her closest relationship is with fellow technological villain <World id="villains/seven-wonders/dsol8" />.

# Drives

- Stop Motormouth from acquiring some rare tech for her body
- Keep Motormouth from stealing a new invention
- Interfere with Motormouth hacking a secure facility

# Panels

A giant jigsaw robot plows through obstacles, then opens fire with a bunch of weapons attached to her body!

The heroes' supposedly secure communication system is broken into.
They hear Motormouth cheerfully mocking their plans for bringing her down,
along with personal insults (such as comments about a hero's costume).

Motormouth has stolen an important gizmo, and now transforms into a more vehicular form
to depart the scene with her loot.

# Variations

## Power

- Motormouth has near-total control of technology, but with what limits?
  Does she need to touch it, or can she remotely hack into things?
  She can potentially wreck a group of tech-dependent heroes. This might be a good or bad thing.
- Motormouth might be limited to electronics or electrical devices.
  Alternatively, she might be able to operate anything that qualifies as a machine,
  even if it's strictly mechanical.
