# D-SOL-8

D-SOL-8 is a member of <World id="villains/seven-wonders" />.

D-SOL-8 does not speak of himself or his past.
His memory is partially cybernetic, which has allowed him to keep secrets even from telepaths like Gnosis.

In truth, he arrived from a dark and distant future.
Although he seemingly has no agenda other than destruction,
in this era he seeks to make subtle changes to events to avert the future he's from.
He does this through subtle hacking, the planting of devices and ideas in key locations,
and occasional direct action.
His methods marked him as a villain, so a villain he became.

D-SOL-8's advanced cybernetics let him manifest numerous weapons and devices.
He can synthesize specific countermeasures for a specific hero's powers.
To avoid giving the present too much information about the future,
he tends to prefer the simplest and lowest-tech device that will get the job done.

# Drives

- Protect someone or something - no matter how unexpected or seemingly ordinary - from D-SOL-8's attack
- Keep D-SOL-8 from sabotaging a new technological creation or scientific discovery
- Any other Drive could somehow involve D-SOL-8, but will doing the heroic thing cause the bad future?

# Panels

D-SOL-8 manifests twin machine guns attached to his forearms, and opens sustained fire on a hero's powered armor or vehicle.

A speedster wants to attack D-SOL-8, so he manifests a laser web around himself that will injure anyone coming close, no matter how fast.

D-SOL-8 dispassionately offers a hero an alliance, just long enough to do one thing:
"You must stop the fire on Norfolk Avenue rather than pursue the villain.
Compliance will earn you five minutes of reprieve from my attacks."

# Variations

## Purpose

- It's not clear what D-SOL-8 really wants, or how he plans to save the future.
  His actions can be seemingly contradictory - saving someone one day, assaulting civilians the next.
- Alternative versions of D-SOL-8 might have a clear, specific purpose.
  In this case, heroes might be able to deduce it, and separate him from Gnosis' control by offering to help.

## Technology

- D-SOL-8 uses some vaguely defined synthesis process to manufacture augmentations for his own body.
  Likewise, he has no clear limits on how much he can produce, or how fast.
- He might use a specific method, such as teleporting parts from an orbital platform or hard-light projection,
  that heroes can find ways to counter.
