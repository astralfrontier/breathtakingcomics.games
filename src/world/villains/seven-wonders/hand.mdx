# The Hand

The Hand is a member of <World id="villains/seven-wonders" />.

Bio:

- The Hand (”is quicker than the eye”) is a villain who presents as a stage magician - top hat and tux, cloak, wands, cards, gadgets. It's clear that they have some kind of supernatural or superhuman power. It's just very unclear what it is!
- Female, ethnicity unclear

Powers:

- The Hand can teleport the team to or from places they need to be, provide illusions and distractions, and otherwise do more or less anything that a professional magician could do - but there's no seeing through their tricks.
