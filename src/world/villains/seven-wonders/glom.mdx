# Glom

Glom is a member of <World id="villains/seven-wonders" />.
She is an athletic woman who wears a hoodie and messenger bag as her costume.

Her body exudes a liquid, which she calls "glom".
She can layer some or all of herself in the stuff, or throw it at a person or object.
The glom substance is something like a ghostly ectoplasm - it's not strictly material, but more like kinetic energy in liquid form.
The stuff seems to have two modes: "attract" which sticks stuff to it, and "repel" which pushes objects away from it.
Glom uses these two modes to create complex effects, such as sticking herself to the ground or to walls,
bouncing enemies' punches harmlessly off her skin, leaping high into the air or bouncing off objects, and so on.

Aside from her power, she makes full use of grappling hooks and lines,
sniper rifles, smoke bombs, and other gadgets.
She has some level of training with military weapons and tactics.

Glom is bouncy, fast, and nimble.
It's easy to drive her away - she'll just bounce away from an incoming attack - but it's hard making her stay away.
She's very hard to seriously injure, thanks to the glom she coats herself with.
She can't go toe-to-toe with powerful heroes, but she can harass them endlessly.

She loves teasing and messing with people.
She forms powerful friendships, sometimes even with heroes, and it's hard to tell what'll attract her interest.
Within the Seven Wonders, her closest friend is <World id="villains/seven-wonders/khyrrsz" />.

# Drives

- Keep Glom from interfering with an official operation
- Deal with Glom assisting another villain on the scene
- Keep an important item or set of documents out of Glom's hands

# Panels

Glom is sniping at superheroes from the rooftop of a distant office building.
When they approach, she retreats into the building, bouncing through the rooms or down an elevator shaft.

Glom bounces at high speed through a subway system,
staying just ahead of flying heroes in hot pursuit.
She'll lead the heroes down a track just as the train is coming.

Glom showers the area with a mixture of attract and repel glom,
setting a trap for anyone who approaches her.
Speedsters who try to simply run at her get knocked into the air,
while the big bruisers are pinned to the ground and must spend moments tearing themselves free.

# Variations

## Glom Effectiveness

- A lot of Glom's power level comes down to the strength of her glom.
  Can it match a super-strong hero's mightiest punch, or is it much weaker?
  The default right answer is "it's as strong as it needs to be in a given scene".
- Alternatively, its strength might come and go based on some factor the heroes can affect.
  Does it get stronger with a nearby source of energy?
  Can it be neutralized with a special radiation?

## Motivation

- By default, Glom is mostly on the Seven Wonders to help her friends.
  She doesn't have much personal motivation, other than those social bonds.
- What if she had a purpose of her own - revenge, greed, or some similar villainous motive?
  Could the heroes find it out, and maybe drive a wedge between her and the other Wonders?
