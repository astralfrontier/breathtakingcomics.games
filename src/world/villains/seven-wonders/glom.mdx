# Glom

Glom is a member of <World id="villains/seven-wonders" />.

Bio:

- Athletic female human being, ethnicity & other factors TBD

Powers:

- Can produce or dispel a liquid effect called “glom” that adheres to her, or can be thrown and adheres to whatever it attaches to
- Glom operates in one of two modes: attract or repel
- Attract means anything that touches the glom sticks to it, like glue
- Repel means anything hitting the glom bounces off of it, like rubber
- An equal amount of attract glom will neutralize an amount of repel glom, and vice versa
- Practical effects include super-leaping and bouncing off things, armor
  (by making things bounce off her body, or glomming durable materials onto herself), wall-running (by glomming her feet),
  trapping opponents (by glomming *their* feet, or the ground around herself as a trap), super-throws (glom someone's arm as they punch, then turn it into a repel glom)
