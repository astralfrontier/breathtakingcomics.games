# The Valkyrie MC

<p><em>{frontmatter.description}</em></p>

Some say they fought their way out of Hell, just for vengeance on the rivals who killed them.
Some say they're the real Valkyries of Norse mythology,
the "choosers of the slain", dressed up for the 21st century.
Some point to half-a-dozen mystic incidents over the years which could have reanimated the dead.
Whatever the case, the Valkyries themselves aren't talking.

What is known is that the Valkyrie Motorcycle Club plays host to at least two dozen visibly undead women.
They're magically reanimated bodies, not merely rotting zombies, and they have unspecified mystic powers.
Each of them rides a heavily customized classic motorcycle of some kind.
All of them are physically armed, from pipes and chains to lever-action shotguns.

The Valks ride the highways and roads, almost always at night.
They aren't just cruising, looking for trouble.
Their rides seem to have a purpose, and sometimes they'll intervene in something that's going down.

# Using the Valkyrie MC

The Valks can inject an air of mystery and violence to a situation.
If they pull up, are they going to start a fight? If so, with whom?

Despite their mystic origin, they aren't heavy hitters and won't go toe-to-toe with supervillains.
As allies, they're not going to just jump into any fight the heroes start.
They can help in other ways, but their allegiances are always to themselves and their mission.
The Valks can be messengers from beyond, informing a group of heroes about a forgotten wrong that needs righting.
They can take someone under their wing who needs protection.
But they'll make the choice of when to show up and who to help.

## Plots

- Tangle with the Valks - or help them against an enemy who earned their ire
- Keep an area clear while the Valkyries conduct some unspecified but important business
- Follow a tip-off from the Valkyries about a mystery to solve

## Dialogue

> "Ride or die."
> 
> "Got told to smile more. Showed him what my teeth look like now. Don't think he's gonna say that ever again."
>
> "Where are we bound for? Heaven, Hell, or Sturgis. Doesn't matter, as long as we all ride together."

## Comic Book Panels

A chorus of roars, sounding halfway between banshee wails and gasoline engines, can be heard.
Two dozen lights dot the night. Two dozen hazy shadows resolve into the tall,
proud figures of the gang as they ride up.

Members of the MC are shown casually lighting cigarettes and taking a drag.
Their glowing eyes compete with the light of the cigarette tips,
as they tell a story or engage in some tough dialogue.
