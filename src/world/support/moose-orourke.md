# Moose O'Rourke

> "This case had more angles than my client had curves"

Moose O'Rourke stands on the high side of six-feet-something.
He's got a moose's head and antlers, and he's freakishly muscular.
He wears gray suits, conservative ties, and he's a private investigator.

He doesn't talk much about his background,
other than suggesting he grew up in a tough neighborhood and that he had to tangle with gangs frequently.
Whatever the truth, he has an eye for detail and a nose that can sniff out BS.
Despite his singular and intimidating appearance, he has a core of kindness he uses to reassure his clients.

Moose O'Rourke lives like a hard-boiled detective in a neo-noir story.
Cases come in, mysterious clients flirt and betray,
bad guys do bad things, and O'Rourke walks the line in shutting them down.
He's a good resource for a hero who needs to dig into the details of a mystery,
without doing the legwork themselves.
