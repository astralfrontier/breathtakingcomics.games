# The Resonants

<p><em>{frontmatter.description}</em></p>

There is a group of people who developed superpowers early in life - at puberty, sometimes before, rarely later.
They have a sort of psychic sense for detecting each other up close.
Thus, they earned the label "Resonants".

At first, all was well.
Resonant heroes and villains emerged, and battled.
Resonants who preferred to live quiet lives could do so - as long as theyr powers didn't physically change them,
and as long as a nearby Resonant didn't choose to out them.

Then, a figure emerged that the Resonants now call "the Prophet".
The Prophet did many great things, saved many lives, and established themselves
as a true hero and a leader.
They could foresee the future, and demonstrated this power reliably enough to convince the world.

Then the Prophet made the pronouncement for which they're named.
"In the future, when a critical mass of Resonants exist on Earth,"
they'd said, "their collective psychic field will kill every human being on the planet."
And then they disappeared.

With the prospect of global annihilation foretold by a seeming authority,
public sentiment toward the Resonants turned.
They were seen as a potential danger. How soon? How big was the "critical mass"? Nobody knew.
But why take chances?

Resonants were shunned.
They were hunted, or attacked openly.
In some places, they were actively culled, whether by authorities or by independent militia.
No two Resonants are born alike. Some have great powers, some have no obvious power at all.
So far there's no reliable way to detect one, aside from the psychic sense that Resonants share with each other.
Still, there's always the fear of being outed by one of their own - a "quisling" -
or that someone will take a dislike to them and apply the label.
And for what?
They didn't choose to be born Resonant.

The community's choices as a whole are clear:
accept the Prophet's words and somehow keep their own numbers down,
or denounce the Prophet and thus turn on the most public hero their kind has ever had.
It's an impossible decision, and every Resonant must face it sooner or later.

# Using the Resonants

The Resonants are a kind of marginalized group.
They aren't a stand-in for any real-life group - no fictional group can ever be that.
But they face prejudice and fear for something outside of their individual or collective control.

The story of the Resonants is the power of public opinion.
Someone has said they're going to do something awful.
Is it true? Who knows. But it's been said, it was widely believed, and it's repeated daily by the fearful.

The Resonants are a definite variation on Marvel's **X-Men** as a whole.
It's intended to provide a much stronger justification for the widespread fear of mutants,
and to acknowledge the various time-travel plots present in the X-Men canon.

## Plots

- Protect some Resonants from a community's fear or reprisals
- Escort a Resonant to a safer place
- Deal with a quisling Resonant who outs their fellows to the authorities or independent vigilantes

# Variations

## The Prophet

- Was the Prophet telling the truth?
  On the one hand, it's a scary prospect to know that sometime in the future, you'll be part of the doom of the planet.
  But even if it's true, maybe there's ways to avert it.
  Research can be done - power suppression drugs, psychic barriers, _something_.
  But it's so much _easier_ for people to just, y'know, prefer that you don't exist.
- What if the Prophet was a quisling?
  Some or all of their career might have been a long con. They might have been sincere until the end,
  or they might have been propped up by some other powerful force that wanted the Resonants gone for its own reasons.
- What if the Prophet lied?
  They might have seen some kind of future, and said what they did in order to set events in motion.
  What if facing constant prejudice and fear is the only way to avert some darker catastrophe after all?
  If individual Resonants learned about this, would they be better pursuing the Prophet's noble secret goals, or revealing the truth?
- It's also possible the Prophet was literally from the future.
  In this case, they could certainly make testable predictions in our era.
  The great mystery, then, is why couldn't they avert the tragedy they predicted?
